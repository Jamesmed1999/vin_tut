1. Create a new repo on github
2. open git bash
3. make your way to the directory of your choosing
4. run command "git init -b main" //initalize main branch for project
5. run command "git remote add origin URL_OF_PROJECT" //links gethub repo to local repo
6. run command "git add ." //adds all files to upload
7. run command "git commit -m "COMMIT COMMENT" " //cannot push files to repo without comment -m stands for message
8. run command "git push -u origin BRANCH_NAME" //pushes the files to remote repo branch. You can pick and choose which branch you want to upload to. -u stands for upstream.

//WHAT ARE BRANCHES?
branches are named after trees. Think of the main branch as the trunk. Each branch is created for a new feature. They are sperated so multiple people
can work on features without disrupting the main, working code base. Once the feature is tested and approved you can merge the branch into main adding the feature.
This is known as Source control mangment.

//I made a mistake! Can i roll it back?
Yes, no change besides deleting branches is permanent. We can cross that rode if we get there.

//DO I need a readme?
You should add a read me to the project after it is in a working state. Make sure to include instructions on what you need to run the program and how to run it.

//Creating branches
run command "git checkout -b BRANCH NAME" <- this is shorthand for "git branch BRANCH_NAME" and "git checkout BRANCH_NAME"
to switch branches use "git checkout BRANCH NAME"
ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT BRANCH BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES

//I MADE CHANGES ON THE WRONG BRANCH IS ALL MY WORK LOST????????
No, in the event of working on the wrong branch do the following.
use command "git stash" this stashes your changes think of it like putting them in a box
use command "git checkout BRANCH_NAME" to changes branches
use command "git stash apply" to take the stashed  changes and apply them to the correct  branch
